Spotif(AI)

Designed and created an application that generates a soundtrack based on a book title using  OpenCV, Sonic Pi, OpenAI, and Python

Spotif(AI) emerged as a collaborative project during the Fall of 2023 within Shirley Leungâ€™s Materiality of Machine Learning course at Parsons.

Implemented through a Python virtual environment on the terminal, Spotif(AI) leverages OpenCV to recognize the title of a book. The identified title is then processed through a sequence of function calls to the OpenAI API, yielding outputs such as a book genre, a music genre (which is mapped to our own assumptions), and a Sonic Pi (Ruby) code snippet. This code snippet can be conveniently copied onto the Sonic IDE player, allowing users to enjoy the generated song.
